## Project Title
RAConv-SEIR: Spatiotemporal Epidemic Forecasting via Domain Shift

## Brief Introduction
This project adapts the RAConv deep learning architecture from cellular traffic prediction to epidemiological forecasting using synthetic SEIR metapopulation data.

Disease spread is simulated across 256 Texas cities with mobility-based coupling and converted into a grid-based spatiotemporal format compatible with RAConv. The objective is to evaluate whether a state-of-the-art spatiotemporal neural network can learn and forecast epidemic dynamics under a controlled, interpretable setting, fulfilling the course requirement of domain shift and technical model adaptation.
